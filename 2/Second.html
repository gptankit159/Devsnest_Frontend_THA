    <h3> Letter to College</h3>
    <p>To the principle,<br> Yeshwantrao chavan college of engineering <br>Wanadongri,Nagpur-440016 <br></p>
    <p>
    Respected sir,<br>
        I am student of 2nd year and urge you to reconsider our fees structure. Amid the pandemic we are not coming to college then also we are paying fees other than tuition fees. <br>
            In these hard days, our parents are not able to earn much and still we are forced to pay about 1.5 lakhs and it is disrupting our economical status. <br>
            With due respect, please reconsider our fees and be fair about it. <br><br>

            Yours sincerely, <br>
            Ankit Ajit Gupta<br>
            Ctech-B-(2019-23)
